### Background

Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE) is a semiparametric, efficient substitution estimator that incorporates machine learning to minimize bias while preserving valid statistical inference.

### Research Focus

The research focused on:

- **Causal Inference Methods**: Advanced applications of TMLE in observational studies
- **Statistical Learning**: Integration of machine learning algorithms with causal inference
- **Efficiency Theory**: Theoretical foundations of efficient influence functions
- **Real-world Applications**: Applying TMLE to complex healthcare datasets

### Key Contributions

- Developed novel applications of TMLE for time-to-event outcomes
- Investigated robustness properties under model misspecification
- Created computational implementations in R and Python
- Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams on biomedical applications

### Technical Stack

- **R**: Primary language for statistical computing and TMLE implementation
- **Python**: Data preprocessing and machine learning components
- **Causal Inference**: TMLE, G-computation, Inverse Probability Weighting
- **Statistical Theory**: Efficiency theory, influence functions, asymptotic analysis

### Publications and Presentations

Research findings were presented at multiple conferences and are being prepared for publication in peer-reviewed journals.
