# Extending Raindrop with Algebraic Topology and Topological Deep Learning

## Overview

Raindrop is a Graph Neural Network (GNN) algorithm designed to infer graph relations among multiple sensors from multivariate time series data. In this project, we extended these graph relations to higher-order dimensions using principles from algebraic topology and topological deep learning. This allows for modeling more complex, higher-dimensional interactions beyond traditional pairwise graph structures.

## Key Contributions

- **Higher-Order Extensions**: By applying algebraic topology, we generalized the sensor relations into simplicial complexes and other topological structures, capturing multi-way interactions.
- **Topological Neural Networks**: We implemented topological deep learning models to process these higher-order structures, enhancing the predictive capabilities on time series data.
- **Libraries Utilized**: The project leverages [TopoModelX](https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoModelX) for building topological neural networks and TopoNetX for handling topological data structures.

## Context

This work was developed as part of the ICML Topological Deep Learning Challenge 2024, contributing to advancements in topological data analysis and machine learning on non-Euclidean domains.
