# Sefira AI: Enhancing LLM Security for Enterprise Chat Applications

## Introduction
As a freelancer for an Entrepreneur First (EF) startup, I contributed to their LLM security platform designed for enterprise consumer-facing chat applications. The platform focuses on preventing harmful outputs such as biases (e.g., racism) and ensuring robust data security.

## Role: Data Leakage Prevention
My primary responsibility was developing the Data Leakage Prevention system. This critical component helps protect sensitive information while maintaining the utility of AI-driven conversations in enterprise settings.

## Technical Implementation
- Fine-tuned a GPT model on proprietary data to assist in formatting desired outputs securely and efficiently.
- Implemented advanced prompt engineering techniques to optimize model behavior.
- Achieved a remarkable 93% accuracy on a private benchmark, representing a significant jump in performance.

## Deployment and Impact
I successfully deployed the solution to the startup's Proof of Concept (POC). This enhancement created a strong "wow effect" during demonstrations, helping the team secure over 70 VC contacts and substantially advancing their funding and partnership opportunities.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and deploying secure AI solutions in enterprise environments.
